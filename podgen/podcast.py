    The following attributes are mandatory:

    * :attr:`~podgen.Podcast.website`
    * :attr:`~podgen.Podcast.description`
    * :attr:`~podgen.Podcast.explicit`

    All attributes can be assigned :obj:`None` in addition to the types
    specified below. Types etc. are checked during assignment, to help you
    discover errors earlier. Duck typing is employed wherever a class in podgen
    is expected.

    There is a **shortcut** you can use when creating new Podcast objects, that
    lets you populate the attributes using the constructor. Use keyword
    arguments with the **attribute name as keyword** and the desired value as
    value. As an example::

        >>> import podgen
        >>> # The following...
        >>> p = Podcast()
        >>> p.name = "The Test Podcast"
        >>> p.website = "http://example.com"
        >>> # ...is the same as this:
        >>> p = Podcast(
        ...     name="The Test Podcast",
        ...     website="http://example.com",
        ... )

    Of course, you can do this for as many (or few) attributes as you like, and
    you can still set the attributes afterwards, like always.

    :raises: TypeError if you use a keyword which isn't recognized as an
        attribute. ValueError if you use a value which isn't compatible with
        the attribute (just like when you assign it manually).
